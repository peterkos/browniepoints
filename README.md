# BrowniePoints

> /ˈbrounē ˌpoint/  
noun  
an imaginary award given to someone who does good deeds or tries to please

This app gives you a way to do just that -- you can send brownie points to friends, and collect achievements as you go!


## Features

Still in alpha, so no real "features" yet. Current goals are to:

- [x] Get a basic UI up and running
- [x] Build persistence for the points 
- [ ] Setup a backend (severless?) + login system (firebase auth)

## Stack

Frontend: Realm, Firebase  
Backend: ???


## Contributing

Once the projects gets to a more beta stage, I'd be happy to accept contributions! However for the time being, things are a bit all over the place :sweat_smile:.
